## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
The purpose of the project is to practice my React.js and express.js skills. The idea is not original but it is interesting and I think making a platform for selling cars as a SPA is more user friendly.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
The project consists of client and server side. They can be used separately or as a whole. 

### Prerequisites
To start the React.js client side part got to client folder open command prompt and type the following text

```
npm install
```
and then
```
npm start
```

And repeat for the rest api in the server folder

```
npm install
```
and then
```
npm start
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>
To use the whole system run the server and the client and then you can start using it.
Users can see other users' ads for cars. If they register into the web app they can add ad themselves and to 
see their profile with their data.
